Q - What is module ??
Answer - module refers to a file containing python statements and definitions. We can define our
most used functions in a module and import it, istead of coping their definitions into different
programs.
Note -- dir() gives all the name of functions defined in the module.
Example -- 
import main
print(dir(main))


Q - What is package??
Answer - Packages are way of structuring Python's modules.
(Package - grouping modules into packages)

Note - a directory must contain a file named __init__.py in order for python to consider it as a package.
This file can be left empty but we generally place the initialization code for that package in this file.

Note -- importing module from package -- import Game.Image.open
Game -- Package, Image -- Sub-Package, Open -- module
